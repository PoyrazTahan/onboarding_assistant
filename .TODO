Update Todo
☐ Turn testing with widget capabilities to run multiple tests at once with configurable input from test.json
☐ Change test.json in a way that we can provide the actual expected result as well and does automatic evaluation as well
☐ Future enhancement - instead of sequential responses, intercept ask_question() calls to supply correct field response based on the 'field' parameter the LLM is actually requesting
