### SYSTEM EVALUATION & RELIABILITY

#### Function Calling Reliability Evals

☐ **Function Call Success Rate Monitoring** (`monitoring/function_evals.py`)

- Track update_data() call rate vs user data inputs
- Track ask_question() call rate vs expected questions
- Target: 99.5%+ function call accuracy

☐ **Function Parameter Validation Evals**

- Validate field names are correct (no typos, valid field names)
- Validate values match expected formats/types
- Test with edge case inputs (empty strings, special characters)

☐ **Function Sequence Validation Evals**

- Ensure proper update_data → ask_question patterns
- Detect missing function calls in conversation flow
- Validate widget field detection accuracy

#### Task Completion Evals

☐ **13-Field Collection Success Rate** (`evals/completion_evals.py`)

- Measure sessions completing all 13 fields
- Track which fields most commonly fail
- Target: 95%+ completion rate

☐ **Widget Chain Completion Evals**

- Test widget sequences of varying lengths (2-10 widgets)
- Measure automatic vs manual continuation rates
- Validate Turkish UI + English data consistency

☐ **Conversation Flow Evals**

- Test different user response patterns (short answers, long answers, questions)
- Measure conversation length and efficiency
- Validate proper conversation termination

#### Robustness Evals

☐ **Edge Case Input Testing** (`evals/robustness_evals.py`)

- Test with typos, numbers as words, mixed languages
- Test with non-cooperative users, joke responses
- Test with incomplete/ambiguous answers
- Target: Graceful handling of 90%+ edge cases

☐ **Error Recovery Evals**

- Test system recovery from widget failures
- Test behavior with corrupted data.json
- Test network/API failure scenarios
- Validate fallback mechanisms work

☐ **Load & Performance Evals**

- Test with rapid user inputs
- Measure response times under load
- Test memory usage with long sessions

#### Data Quality Evals

☐ **Data Integrity Validation** (`evals/data_quality_evals.py`)

- Validate all saved data matches user inputs
- Test type conversions (age→int, weight→float)
- Verify widget value/display mappings
- Check for data corruption or loss

☐ **Consistency Evals**

- Test multiple sessions produce consistent behavior
- Validate same inputs always produce same outputs
- Test session state persistence and recovery

#### Automated Eval Framework

☐ **Eval Test Suite** (`evals/test_suite.py`)

- Automated test runner for all eval categories
- Generate eval reports with success/failure metrics
- Integration with CI/CD for continuous monitoring

☐ **Synthetic User Simulator** (`evals/user_simulator.py`)

- Generate realistic user response patterns
- Simulate various user personalities (cooperative, difficult, confused)
- Run large-scale automated testing sessions

☐ **Eval Metrics Dashboard** (`monitoring/eval_dashboard.py`)

- Real-time reliability metrics visualization
- Historical trend tracking for all eval categories
- Alert system for degraded performance

#### Production Monitoring Evals

☐ **Live Session Monitoring** (`monitoring/live_evals.py`)

- Track real user session success rates
- Monitor function call patterns in production
- Detect and alert on reliability degradation

☐ **A/B Testing Framework** (`evals/ab_testing.py`)

- Test function description variations
- Compare different prompt engineering approaches
- Measure impact of system changes on reliability
