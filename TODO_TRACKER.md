# TODO Tracker - Medical & Psychological Health App

## Overview
This tracker maintains the implementation status of each phase, notes, and lessons learned.

## Phase Status

### Phase 1A: Project Structure & Data Foundation
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create basic project structure and data foundation
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Set up Python project structure
  - [x] Create data folder structure with sample user data
  - [x] Create questions configuration file
  - [x] Create sample actions file
  - [x] Create simple test framework
  - [x] Update data structure with English field names and Turkish titles
  - [x] Add exclude_conditions to actions
  - [x] Add detailed notes for free-form field text-to-number conversion
  - [x] Fix file naming (AI_immutable.json)
  - [x] Update questions.json with better validation notes
  - [x] Move widget fields to AI_immutable.json
  - [x] Keep only free-form fields in AI_mutable.json
  - [x] Update test framework for new structure
- **Notes**: All tests passing. Data structure properly separated between mutable/immutable files. Ready for API integration.
- **Lessons Learned**: 
  - File naming: AI_immutable_json.json → AI_immutable.json
  - **Data separation**: Widget fields (read-only) → AI_immutable.json, Free-form fields (read-write) → AI_mutable.json
  - session_state.json is immutable from LLM side
  - Actions need exclude_conditions in addition to trigger_conditions (e.g., mammogram excluded for males)
  - Free-form fields need special handling for text-to-number conversion ("twenty" → 20)
  - English field names with Turkish titles for better LLM processing
  - Detailed validation notes for Answer Handler LLM guidance
  - **LLM Access**: AI_mutable.json (3 fields: age, height, weight) - LLM can read/write
  - **LLM Access**: AI_immutable.json (10 widget fields) - LLM can read only

### Phase 1B: API Integration & Cost Tracking
- **Status**: COMPLETED
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Establish LLM API connections with comprehensive cost tracking
- **Tasks**:
  - [x] Install Semantic Kernel dependencies
  - [x] Create Gemini API integration (GoogleAIChatCompletion)
  - [x] Create OpenAI API integration (OpenAIChatCompletion) 
  - [x] Test basic prompt-response flow
  - [x] Implement unified API cost tracking system
  - [x] Create abstracted utils/api_tracker.py
  - [x] Test both providers with tracking
  - [x] Document API usage patterns
- **Notes**: Both Gemini and OpenAI working with comprehensive tracking
- **Key Achievement**: Unified API tracker supporting multiple providers
- **Lessons Learned**:
  - **Cost Efficiency**: Gemini 1.5-flash ~$0.000005/call vs OpenAI gpt-4o-mini ~$0.000020/call (4x difference)
  - **Performance**: OpenAI ~20% faster, Gemini more cost-effective
  - **Architecture**: Abstracted tracker enables easy provider switching
  - **Simplicity**: Removed unnecessary config.py - keep configuration where it's used
  - **Tracking Value**: Real-time cost monitoring essential for production
  - **Provider Comparison**: Unified tracking enables data-driven provider selection

### Phase 2: Monolith Agent & MCP Protocol Design
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Create single monolith agent first, then design MCP protocol for data operations
- **Phase 2A: Monolith Agent**:
  - [ ] Create single agent that handles all operations
  - [ ] Implement data reading capabilities (AI_mutable.json, AI_immutable.json)
  - [ ] Add basic conversation flow
  - [ ] Test with existing data structure
- **Phase 2B: MCP Protocol Planning**:
  - [ ] Design MCP protocol for read/write operations
  - [ ] Plan widget trigger operations
  - [ ] Define LLM permission boundaries
  - [ ] Architect data access patterns
- **Key Considerations**:
  - **Iteration Strategy**: Start simple with monolith, then split into agents
  - **MCP Questions**: LLM permissions, read/write patterns, widget integration
  - **Data Access**: How should LLM interact with AI_mutable vs AI_immutable?
  - **Architecture**: Balance between simplicity and extensibility
- **Notes**: Requires planning phase to resolve MCP architecture questions

### Phase 3: Data Flow Implementation
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Add basic read/write capabilities with JSON files
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Create data folder structure
  - [ ] Implement JSON read/write functions
  - [ ] Connect agents to data files
  - [ ] Test data persistence
- **Notes**: No validation or error handling initially

### Phase 4: Answer Handler Agent
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: HIGH
- **Description**: Implement conversational interface for user interaction
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Create conversation prompts
  - [ ] Implement data extraction logic
  - [ ] Handle widget vs free-form inputs
  - [ ] Connect to data writing
- **Notes**: This is the main user-facing component, prioritize user experience

### Phase 5: Question State Management
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Track which questions have been asked/answered
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Create state tracker
  - [ ] Skip answered questions logic
  - [ ] Handle returning users
  - [ ] Session persistence
- **Notes**: Simple file-based state management

### Phase 6: Action Recommendation System
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Basic rule-based health action suggestions
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Implement rule engine
  - [ ] Create priority logic
  - [ ] Track recommendations
- **Notes**: Start with hardcoded if-then rules

### Phase 7: Data Persistence Layer
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: MEDIUM
- **Description**: Implement two-layer storage system
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] JSON layer for immediate updates
  - [ ] Database sync placeholder
  - [ ] Conflict resolution
- **Notes**: Focus on JSON layer, mock database initially

### Phase 8: Session Management
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: LOW
- **Description**: Handle incomplete sessions and state recovery
- **Tasks**:
  - [ ] Timeout detection
  - [ ] Session recovery
  - [ ] Context restoration
- **Notes**: Can be basic initially

### Phase 9: Advanced Features
- **Status**: PENDING
- **Priority**: LOW

  - [ ] Dynamic question ordering
  - [ ] Advanced action prioritization
  - [ ] Comprehensive error handling
  - [ ] Full database integration
- **Notes**: Define based on learnings from earlier phases
